# 👋 Sean Christopher Davis

**Veteran. Developer. Technologist. Systems Thinker.**

I'm Sean — a former U.S. Army service member turned web developer and information systems professional. I’ve been building websites since 2008, with experience spanning PHP, JS, React, Angular, Tailwind, Firebase, and more. I believe in intelligent systems, clean design, and living with rhythm.

After years of remote work and entrepreneurship, I earned my BS in Information Systems & Technology from the University of Missouri–St. Louis. I now focus on building thoughtful platforms, evolving personal systems, and preparing for long-term relocation to the Netherlands.
