    "description": "While working toward my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems at UMSL, I applied for a study abroad program in Germany. My time in Germany was transformative, and it solidified my desire to move to Europe. During this time, I also visited the Netherlands for the first time, which sparked my interest in relocating there. I was even able to fly two of my younger sisters to spend a few days with me in the Netherlands, and they loved it too. The program ended and I returned to the U.S. in July 2024, but I knew I wanted to return to Europe permanently. I made the decision to start planning my move to the Netherlands.",

    "description": "Upon returning from Germany and with a clear vision of my future in the Netherlands, I began the process of downsizing my belongings. I immediately sold my car, which was my way of confirming for myself that I was serious about this move. It was the first step in a series of logistical preparations that included selling or donating furniture, clothes, and other possessions that no longer fit my future. I also transferred to the smallest apartment in my current building, not only slashing $1000 off my monthly rent, but forcing me to live with less \"stuff\". I set the goal to move with one single bag.",

    "description": "Admittedly, I knew very little about visas at this point. I started researching the various visa options available for moving to the Netherlands. It took about a week of research before I found the Dutch American Friendship Treaty (DAFT) visa. This visa was appealing because it allowed me to start a business in the Netherlands and live there for up to 2 years, with the possibility of extension. The business can be a simple sole proprietorship, which suited my needs as a software developer. I easily met the requirements for the DAFT visa, and the work requirements (entrepreneurship) aligned perfectly with my background. I was already freelancing/contracting and had clients, which would help me meet the income requirements for the visa. At this point, it's just another one of my several moves to a new city (but this time across the Atlantic Ocean).",

    "description": "I don't care how much of the Dutch population speaks English. Learning the local language is a sign of respect and a way to integrate into society. I started learning Dutch in July 2024, using the app Duolingo. It was the easiest and most obvious way to get started. I supplemented my learning with YouTube videos, books, podcasts, ChatGPT and Dutch courses. I also started listening to Dutch music and watching Dutch TV shows with English subtitles to immerse myself in the language. By the end of 2024, I was a strong A2 level in Dutch with B1 so close I could taste it. Ik kan met zekerheid zeggen dat ik een beetje Nederlands spreek. Het is a moeilijke taal maar ik studeer en oefen elke dag. Geen Google Translate.",

    "description": "Up to this point, I had been to several cities in in both Germany and the Netherlands (NL). However, in NL, I had only spent a decent amount of time in Amsterdam. I wasn't convinced that was my only option. So, I flew back to NL for the sole purpose of \"city shopping.\" Alongside another one of my sisters I spent several days exploring Rotterdam - a city I knew I would enjoy after plenty of research. I also visited and explored Utrecht. There was no doubt in my mind that Rotterdam was my speed. Plus, considering how small the Netherlands is, I could easily travel anywhere in the country within a few hours by train. I decided Rotterdam was the perfect fit for me. My sister agreed.",

    "description": "From the outside looking in, I still live in the U.S. In my mind, the move has already begun. That means I would need to make decisions as though I was in the middle of moving, not as if the move was coming in the future. I set a savings target of â‚¬14,500, which is â‚¬4,500 for the DAFT visa business account reserve plus an additional â‚¬10,000 for securing an apartment paying any fees. I actually set this savings target in October during my visit to Rotterdam. Because I had already sold my car and downsized my living expenses significantly, I was able to save aggressively (pure strategy). I opened a Wise account to hold my Euros. I am already the type to track my finances meticulously using Excel. So, every time money came in, I already knew exactly how much of it to transfer, leaving the rest for my U.S. expenses.",

I'll turn in my keys and head straight to the airport. ðŸŽ‰ After arriving in the Netherlands on the 23rd, I'll stay in a hotel for the remainder of September. On October 1st, I'll check into a short-term rental in Rotterdam, secured through HousingAnywhere. These types of rentals allow address registration (inschrijven, meaning you can inform the local municipality that this is your address), which is necessary for the DAFT visa application. With a registered address, I can secure a BSN (Dutch social security number, can be done in one day) and open a business account with a local Dutch bank (can also be done in one day). I'll then register my business as a sole proprietorship (ZZP'er, a freelancer) with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel). With a registered address, BSN, and â‚¬4,500 deposited into the business account, I can officially apply for the DAFT visa. Approval is nearly guaranteed. Once approved, I live in the Netherlands. That's it. Done.",
